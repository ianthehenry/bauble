# General overview

Okay look this is some really early documentation. It is, as you can see, very much unfinished.

- argument order is not significant; the types of values are significant
- probably the most useful functions in order are [`move`](#move), [`union`](#union), [`rotate`](#rotate), the [shape primitives](#shapes), [`color`](#color), and [`shade`](#shade).

Alright, deep breath.
