When you first visited Bauble, you were greeted by an interactive tutorial. You can restore it by deleting your script (just clear out the text field) and then refreshing the page. Make sure to save a backup of your script if you've done something interesting!

Some general notes:

- Argument order is usually not significant; only the types of values are significant. Argument order *is* significant when a function takes multiple arguments of the same type, such as `torus` -- the major radius must come before the minor radius.
- Probably the most useful functions in order are [`move`](#move), [`union`](#union), [`rotate`](#rotate), the [shape primitives](#shapes), [`color`](#color), and [`shade`](#shade).

All of the examples on this page are interactive. To prevent annoying scroll hijacking, you have to click on a canvas to focus it before you can zoom.
